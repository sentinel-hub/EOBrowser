One of the biggest culprits is the slash and burn agriculture, called [tavy](https://www.madamagazine.com/en/english-tavy-kahlschlag-einer-insel/), where the forest is burnt and then farmed in the following months. The other deforestation causes include grazing, logging and production of coal. The forest grows back after being cut down, but until then, the barren soil is vulnerable to erosion by heavy rains, depositing it into rivers, which carry it into the sea, contaminating sea life with deposited iron oxides. As soil formation is a process taking thousands of years, it erodes away each year, until it can no longer support a forest. Due to these processes, Madagascar has already lost [80 % of its primary forests](https://www.eoi.es/blogs/guidopreti/2014/02/04/deforestation-in-madagascar-a-threat-to-its-biodiversity/), causing many indigenous species, such as [lemurs](https://monkeysandmountains.com/lemurs-madagascar/), to be endangered.',

The most prominent thoeory believes, that it's the result of the volcanism and erosion.

          "The [optical thickness of a cloud](https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/optical-thickness.html) is the degree to which the cloud prevents light from passing through it. By measuring how much sunlight gets scattered by clouds back up into space, scientists can better understand how much [clouds influence Earth's climate](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MYDAL2_M_CLD_OT). Optical thickness depends on the clouds [physical constitution](http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Optical_thickness) (crystals, drops, droplets), and form; the overall effect depends on the particles concentration, scatter parameter and phase function, as well as the vertical extent of the cloud.",

The 20 km long glacier has two remarkable [medial moraines](https://www.nps.gov/articles/lateralmedialmoraines.htm), formed by joining ice streams. These moraines contrast with the brighter ice and appear clearly in Sentinel-2 images. However, the stunning features of the glacier may not be observable for long: [a recent study](https://www.nps.gov/rlc/oceanalaska/upload/Bear-Glacier-RB_FINAL_12-17-19_508-compliant.pdf) has shown that Bear Glacier has been dramatically retreating  (237 m per year)  over the two last decades.',

[The Erebus ice tongue glacier](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/4965/erebus-ice-tongue) in Antarctica comes down from Mt. Erebus and protrudes off the coast of Ross Island, forming an 11-12 km long ice tongue—a long and narrow sheet of ice projecting out from the coastline. When the sea ice in McMurdo Sound thaws in the summer, the ice tongue floats on the water without thawing. It also calves in some places forming icebergs. The Erebus Ice Tongue is only about 10 meters high, so its icebergs are small. When the ice around the tongue melts in the summer, waves of sea water constantly batter the edges of the tongue, carving very elaborate structures in the ice, sometimes producing deep caves at the margins. In the winter, the sea freezes once more around these new shapes.',

It travels an average of 130 feet in 24 hours and calves more than 45 cubic kilometers of icebergs each year into the Ilulissat Icefjord. Its front is an enormous ice wall—stretching 91 meters at its peak, that constantly explodes. Icebergs break off the glacier accompanied by blasts and roars akin to a rocket launch. When they hit the sea below, the calved icebergs can create huge waves that threaten to swallow people, boats, and buildings. The icebergs from Sermeq Kujalleq have crashed so violently that they have even caused earthquakes. Because the glacier is so large, the breaks seem to occur in __slow motion__.',
