          "Many of the Earth's rivers have been altered by dams and reservoirs, providing renewable hydropower and water supply for human use. However, these dams disrupt the habitat network and have a negative effect on water quality. The world's largest dam removal project on the Klamath river in California and Oregon, USA, includes the demolition of four dams, with guided regeneration of the up-and downstream habitats. This project is reopening access for salmon and other migratory fish to more than 600 km of the river system. In addition to their importance for biodiversity, salmon are also a key element of local First Nations culture. [The Klamath River Dam Removal]( https://whitewatertours.com/klamath-river-dam-removal-project-summer-2024-update/) project paves the way for other large-scale riparian habitat restoration projects, providing an example for responsible stewardship of nature.

The weather services reported the highest snow depths for this time of year since recording (e.g. 45 cm for Munich). The trigger for the huge masses of snow was a moisture-rich warm front from south-western Europe, which collided with a cold front from Scandinavia over the northern Alpine foothills. What offered perfect conditions for all winter enthusiasts caused chaos, frustration and considerable obstructions on other fronts. Traffic in the region came to a standstill, airports were not operating, sport events had to be canceled and the subsequent snowmelt a few days later led to flooded fields and roads [[1](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/02/snow-chaos-southern-germany-munich-airport-suspends-flights)].',

This time of year is normally the driest part of the year in the region, but the current conditions are exceptional.

On the north bank, the fields are more regularly spaced and have a lower moisture content, while on the south bank the fields are more diverse in both size and orientation and have a higher moisture content. As the region generally has quite low annual precipitation (~500 mm/year), one explanation for the moisture difference could be the higher prominence of the lakes south of the river, but different field management techniques could also play a role. Cereals are the main crop grown in the region, with rapeseed, sugar beet and potatoes grown to a lesser extent.

          'Agricultural land in Egypt can be divided into two main categories; Old Lands and New Lands. Old Lands represent highly fertile soils, which are located in the Nile Delta. Due to the River Nile deposits and the highly productive nature of the soil, these areas have been traditionally cultivated with strategic cereal crops, such as rice, wheat and maize, preserving food security for the Egyptian people. During the past four decades, these areas have been encroached by dramatic urban sprawl due to the rapid population growth and economic development. Therefore, there has been a pressing need for the government to find alternative solutions to maintain the sustainability of the national agricultural sector. Consequently, the adopted policies by the government to reclaim new lands in the desert have led to the second category (New Lands). These are barren areas located in the Western and Eastern deserts outside the green zone of the Nile Delta. The New Lands process includes accessibility through constructing roads, houses, installing irrigation and drainage systems and providing reliable sources of water and electricity. Tiba district is one of those newly reclaimed areas located in the western Nile Delta of Egypt with a total area of 125 square km.

          "In a typical year, rainfall during the wet season (December through March) recharges the Bolivian lake Poopó directly and via increased inflow from the Desaguadero River. In 2015, the lake dried up. This is not the first time that Poopó has evaporated; the lake last dried up in 1994. In that case, it took several years for water to return, and even longer for ecosystems to recover. Despite its history, in 2016 and 2017, as the waters still haven't returned, many environmentalists believed the waters will not return this time. There are multiple reasons as to why the droughts in the area are getting worse. Sitting high in the Bolivian Andes, the saline lake is particularly vulnerable to fluctuations because it is shallow — typically no more than 3 meters (9 feet) deep. Due to climate change the area has warmed an estimated one degree Celsius over the past century, leading to an increase in the rate of evaporation from the lake. And the lack of rain over the past year has sped the process even further. The government blamed the drought solely on El Nino and climate change, but even though this is one of the causes, it seems the management of the lake is also the problem. Some of the water that is supposed to fill the lake is being diverted for agriculture and mining. Even when water is available, the river is often clogged with sedimentation, due to the runoff from development and mining in the area. What happened to Lake Poopó is not unlike the drying of the vast Aral Sea in Central Asia. In both cases, a closed water system was overdrawn, with more water going out than coming in. However, in summer 2018, the lake filled up again, although the water line is clearly diminished compared to 2004. If all the problems persist, there is legitimate concern, that next time, the lake might stay dry forever.

          'In the 1960s, the Soviet Union undertook a major water diversion project on the arid plains of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The region’s two major rivers, fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains, were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops. Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. The lake they made, the Aral Sea, was once the fourth largest in the world. Although irrigation made the desert bloom, it devastated the Aral Sea. As the Aral Sea has dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields, degrading the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water. The loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier. Additionally, as the Aral water content diminishes, salinization of the lake increases. This creates vertical stratification, where surface salinity is lower than the bottom layer, thus heating up faster. This additionally contributes to water evaporation, creating a positive feedback loop.

Initial signs for 2019 had been encouraging after glacier snow cover was measured at 20-40% higher than normal in April and May, following a very cold January with lots of precipitation. However the third-hottest summer since records began meant melting accelerated dramatically. Melting was particularly severe in eastern Switzerland and the northern side of the Alps. More than 500 glaciers have completely disappeared in Switzerland since 1850, and 2019 saw the Pizol glacier removed from the country's glacier monitoring network. Most glaciers in Central Europe, Western Canada and the United States will vanish in the second half of this century if current rates of ice loss continue.

          'The controversial Belo Monte mega-dam in Pará state has done significant socio-environmental harm to the Xingu River and the indigenous and traditional people living beside it. Project designers appear to have seriously overestimated the Xingu River flow rates and failed to account for fluctuations between wet and dry seasons, while also not accounting for reductions in flow due to deforestation caused by rapidly expanding cattle ranches and soy plantations. Due to escalating climate change and drought that are reducing Xingu River flow, the dam seems almost certain to never fulfill promised economic or energy-producing goals. The dam diverts the Xingu River’s natural flow into a constructed channel, then into a reservoir and to the main electricity-producing Belo Monte dam, largely drying up the river in its original path. Tens of thousands of indigenous and traditional people were forced from their homes, and had to give up their fishing livelihoods. Today, the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam stands as a warning – proof of the damage caused by ill-conceived Amazon mega-projects.

Due to massive deforestation of rainforests and mangroves, the Betsiboka Estuary is subject to catastrophic soil erosion. During each rain event, iron-rich silt sediments are washed from the bare hills into the river system, giving the river its characteristic reddish brown colour. The large sediment plumes eventually deposit in the ecologically important Bombetoka Bay, threatening the balance of this haven for Madagascar's endemic fauna. In late January 2020, torrential rains in the northern part of the island caused severe flooding in the region, which in turn had a major impact on local communities and the ecosystem.

There is unsurprisingly a [legend](https://www.topchinatravel.com/china-attractions/misha-hill-and-crescent-spring.htm) that narrates the formation of the singing sand dunes, however, the [real cause](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121031-singing-sand-dunes-physics-science-whistling/) is the friction and static created as the wind shifts the sand or as people slide down the steep slopes of the sand dunes from the top. On days when a strong wind blows, the fast shifting sand roars, but when light wind blows, the sand produces a gentle, dulcet sounds akin to music. When sliding on the steep slopes of sand dunes from the top, the drifting sands look like beautiful brocades hung up on the sand dunes, accompanied with beautiful singing sound. The singing sounds like the sound from traditional Chinese music instruments. Hence, the dune gets its name because of the singing sound of the sand. The sands really do sing! Sunrise and sunset are times of great beauty at the edge of the desert. Modest cameras can capture great moments but for the technologically advanced, better equipment will reveal amazing colors!',

As a stream flows down a hill, it picks up sand and other particles, called alluvium. The rushing water carries alluvium to a flat plain, where the stream leaves its channel to spread out.

As its name suggests, Knockan Crag is a cliff that rises to a height of 300 m above sea level. It is hard not to get excited about rocks and geology at Knockan Crag as it holds the key to an amazing story of colliding continents and [scientific intrigue](https://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/~oesis/nws/loc-knockan.html). Knockan Crag is internationally renowned due to the presence of a geological feature called the "[Moine Thrust](https://www.geological-digressions.com/tag/knockan-crag/)" first identified here in the 1860s. The Moine Thrust is a major near horizontal geological fault affecting the rocks, whereby the older rocks have been pushed towards, up and over younger rocks. This is the place where [Moine metamorphic](https://www.scottishgeology.com/best-places/knockan-crag/) rocks have ended up on top of limestone, and at the Moine Thrust at Knockan Crag you can put your hands on these two very different rocks. [Nature trails](http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Knockan_Crag,_North-west_Highlands_-_an_excursion) ascending up and along the crag lead tourists through striking succession of weathering [Cambrian sediments](https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/GeositesKnockan) overlain by the older Moine rocks. Infact, crystalline Moine metamorphic rocks sit on top of a sequence of undisturbed sedimentary rocks which have not been affected by the activity that deformed the overlying rocks. For more than 100 years geologists have used Knockan Crag to help in understanding mountain building and tectonic plates across the world.',

[The Great Blue Hole of Belize](https://www.marineinsight.com/environment/what-is-the-great-blue-hole-of-belize/), located off the coast of Belize, is one of such wonders. Circular in shape with a diameter of 300 m, the water depth in this hole is 125 m, which gives it a deep blue color in contrast with the aquamarine color of the water neighboring it. Researchers say this giant underwater [sinkhole](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/sinkholes?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) was originally formed during the last glacial period as a limestone cave when the sea levels were lower. As the ocean began to rise due to [thawing](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/) of polar ice caps, the cave system flooded and eventually collapsed, creating a “vertical cave” in the ocean. As such, this swallow hole is popular among divers, who flock to the area to see the geological formations that now lie in the ocean’s depths. [Researcher divers](https://geographical.co.uk/people/explorers/item/3132-explore-belize-blue-hole) have found huge [stalactites and stalagmites](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/stalactite.html) below the surface, some even reaching 9 – 12 m in length. They say that the deeper one goes, the water becomes clearer and the formations, more complex.

It is a long, deep, narrow body of water that reaches far inland. Fjords are often set in a U-shaped valley with steep walls of rock on either side. While fjords are not just a Norwegian phenomenon and can be found in other mountainous regions, the [fjords of Norway](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Fjords_of_Norway) are particularly famous, spread all over the country and easily accessible as the fjord-dominated landscape runs like a strip all around Norway's coast. They were formed thousands of years ago by retreating glaciers, allowing the sea to flood in the remaining space. In the last [ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age), glaciers moving very slowly over time carved deep valleys. This is why fjords can be very deep farther inland where the glacial force was strongest, e.g. [Sognefjord](https://www.visitflam.com/activities/fjord-cruise-sognefjord/), is 1308 m deep at its deepest and gets shallow towards the sea. Some features of fjords include [coral reefs](https://marinelab.fsu.edu/labs/brooke/research/deep-sea-corals/norwegian-fjords/) and rocky islands called [skerries](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skerry).

          'Natron is a fascinating lake, deadly to most animals, that are not accustomed to its alkaline environment. The dangerously high PH of 10.5 is caused by sodium carbonate flowing in from the surrounding hills, active with volcanism. Sodium carbonate deposits serve as a preservant, calcifying the carcasses of deceased animals. Despite the harsh ecosystem, some species survive here. On its shores, flocks of flamingos, which have evolved leathery skin to tolerate the water, find a safe nesting place, as predators avoid the area. The stunning red color is caused by cyanobacteria, that thrive in the dry season, as salinity rises due to evaporation.

When the sea ice in McMurdo Sound thaws in the summer, the ice tongue floats on the water without thawing. It also calves off in places forming icebergs. The Erebus Ice Tongue is only about 10 meters high, so its icebergs are small. When the ice around the tongue melts in the summer, waves of sea water constantly batter the edges of the tongue, carving very elaborate structures in the ice, sometimes producing deep caves at the margins.

Baltimore however stands out for the extent of the gap, its relation to [race](https://wp.nyu.edu/economicinequality/2017/03/29/economic-inequality-in-baltimore-md/), as well as the proximity of the two extremes. The gap here is twice as large as in New York, and one of the largest in the country. To represent the [extent of economic inequality](https://wp.nyu.edu/economicinequality/2017/03/29/economic-inequality-in-baltimore-md/), the typical Baltimore resident in the bottom fifth of earners made $13,588 in 2013, whereas those in top 5 percent made an average of $166,924 that year.

One of the reasons for this is Baltimore's abnormaly high crime rate. The city has by far the highest robbery rate in America and there's a murder almost every day. The main perpetrators of crime are drug gangs. On top of the low standard of living, the poor Baltimore youth has a low chance of escaping this environment and high incidence of substance abuse, PTSD and depression.",

It is so important to the city that it is theorized even its name originates from it. This wonder of nature is now under human control. In the 19th century dumping of raw sewage into the Thames and gas manufactories built alongside the river deteriorated it to a point where the discharge of methane gas in the depths of the river caused the water to bubble, and the toxins wore away at boats\' propellers. Chlorine-soaked drapes were hung in the windows of Parliament in an attempt to stave off the smell of the river, but to no avail and four serious cholera outbreaks killed tens of thousands of people between 1832 and 1865. The river was declared biologically dead. Now in 2020, there are 45 locks on the river, each with one or more adjacent barriers. These lock and barrier combinations are used for controlling the flow of water down the river, most notably when there is a risk of flooding. The river recovered to a point where it\'s bustling with salmon, herons, cormorants, moorhen and even seals. The city also had a huge problem with [air pollution](https://www.britannica.com/place/London/Climate#ref92695).

It spans over the mighty Yan mountain range (seen on the left side of the pin), which separates the North China Plain on the south from the Mongolian Plain on the north. The rumor that the wall is visible from space is a widely believed myth, called into question in October 2003, after the first Chinese astronaut returned from his  journey into Space, and stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. The European Space Agency then claimed that the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye in an orbit between 160 and 320 km and even published a picture of a part of the “Great Wall” photographed from Space. In this picture the wall looked like a route full of bends that resembled river meanders. One week later, when everything seemed perfectly clear and the myth had been finally reborn, another message from ESA acknowledged that the Great Wall in the picture was actually a river! Looking at what we learned about the human visual system and its limits, it is impossible for humans to see the wall from space with our own eyes.

It has a well developed education system, with [50 % of the workforce having a university degree](https://www.narcity.com/ca/on/toronto/lifestyle/50-fun-facts-every-true-torontonian-will-definitely-love). One of the most distinctive features of the geography of Toronto is the Toronto [ravine system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_ravine_system#cite_note-1). It is a network of deep ravines that form a large urban forest that runs throughout much of the city. For the most part designated as parkland, the ravines are largely undeveloped. Toronto\'s slogan "_The city within a park_" partially stems from the extensive ravine green space with some 10 million trees and 1,500 parks, covering 18 % of the city area. The terrain that the city of Toronto sits on was formed by glaciers after the end of the last ice age about 12,000 years ago. Over the millennia, small rivers and creeks eroded the soil, cutting deep ravines through what is today the Toronto region. Despite the dense population of metropolitan Toronto, many of the ravines have been left close to their natural state, due to the danger of flooding. Every few decades, a massive flooding event occurs. The most recent event was in 1954, when Hurricane Hazel, dropping over 12 cm of rain onto the city in a single day. In the post-war years, several developments had begun to encroach on the ravine lands, and these neighbourhoods were badly damaged by the storm. The whole blocks were washed away and 81 people killed. This disaster led to an almost complete ban on development in the ravines, and a new Region Conservation Authority was created to maintain them as open spaces.',

By the 13th century, Mogadishu became prosperous by trading gold, livestock, slaves, leather, and ivory. Despite the growing affluence in the city of Mogadishu, the country as a whole suffered from political instability under the dictatorship of President Mohamed Siad Barre who ruled the nation from 1969 to 1991. The unstable political environment worsened in 1992 when an extreme famine hit Somalia. The United Nations intervened to ensure the equal distribution of aid and prevent the new government from abusing its power. The mission was unsuccessful and the UN left the port city in 2002 after one of its officials was kidnapped. By 2008 officials estimated that nearly half of the city’s residents, over one million people, had fled to the countryside.  Since 2008 nearly 3,000 African Union peacekeeping troops have patrolled the city to try to maintain order and provide medical aid.

It has a highly-developed tech infrastructure, widespread public wifi, and 60 percent of South Koreans own a smartphone. To battle urban sprawl and overpopulation issues, Seoul built many residential buildings, an extensive subway system and set up a greenbelt around a large part of the city’s perimeter, which prohibits further extension of the built-up area. As a result, urban sprawl has extended to places outside the greenbelt, creating new residential areas in suburbs and satellite cities.',

It was likely the largest city in the world containing over one million inhabitants at its peak. It began to decline in the "Iranian Intermezzo" of the 9th to 11th centuries, and was destroyed in the Mongolian invasion in 1258. Baghdad regained prominence only when it became the capital of Iraq in 1920; over the next half century, the city took on all the characteristics of a modern metropolis. The city was heavily damaged by aerial bombardment during the Persian Gulf War and again by air and ground operations during the Iraq War. During the interwar period the city’s services and infrastructure deteriorated badly because of inattention and economic sanctions. In recent years, it found itself the victim of several attacks, especially from al-Qaeda and its successor, the Islamic State.',

Delhi is a city of great historical significance as an important commercial, transport, and cultural hub, as well as the political centre of India. It has been the centre of succession of mighty empires and powerful kingdoms. The animal life of Delhi, like its plant life, is quite diverse. Among carnivorous animals are leopards, hyenas, foxes, wolves, and jackals, which inhabit the ravine lands and hilly ridges. Monkeys are found in the city, especially around some of the temples and historical ruins. Birdlife is profuse; year-round species include pigeons, sparrows, kites, parrots, partridges, bush quail, and, on the ridges, peafowl. In the demographic history of Delhi, a turning point was the year 1947, when thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from predominantly Muslim Pakistan entered the city in the wake of India’s independence. Since that time the population has grown steadily, with an ongoing heavy flow of immigrants, most arriving from other Indian states or from adjacent countries. The religious composition of Delhi’s population is diverse. The great majority of the residents are Hindu, adherents of Islam constitute form the largest minority, followed by smaller numbers of Sikhs, Jains, Christians, and Buddhists. The service sector is the most important part of Delhi’s economy, and it is the city’s largest employer. The city struggles with challenges brought by overcrowding, such as sub-standard housing, air pollution and traffic congestion.',

Since records began, there have been mostly [Strombolian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strombolian_eruption) and sometimes [Vulcanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanian_eruption). Volcanism in this area is caused by the subduction of the Indo-Australian plate under the Pacific plate. The Yasur is known to be a major contributor to global volcanic sulphur dioxide emissions. In 2004-2005, 7.9 kg/sec were measured. This represented about 2% of global volcanic emissions of this gas. Ashfall brings nutrients to local vegetation, which is also affected by volcanic gases in the downwind area and acid rain.

Erta Ale is only 613 m high but, as is typical of a shield volcano, has very gentle slopes and a large base with a diameter of 40 km. The summit is bounded by a complex, elongated caldera, 1700 x 600 m wide, containing huge lava flows and several larger and smaller craters.

The reason for this is the consistency of its lava, which is uncharacteristically fluid and can therefore flow at up to 100 km per hour. In comparison, lava normally moves at a speed of 1 to 10 km per hour due to its high density. Nyiragongo is a stratovolcano, which means that its eruptions can be explosive. Moreover, the walls of the 600-metre deep crater in which the lava is trapped can break at any moment. This happened on 10 January 1977 and had devastating consequences. Unfortunately, the volcano isn't well explored. Therefore, it's impossible to predict such events in the future. Learn more [here](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/63/).",
